<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Benchtop Biochemical Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Automated</li><li>Semi Automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Benchtop Biochemical Analyzers are available in two main types: Fully Automated and Semi Automated. Fully Automated analyzers are capable of performing all testing processes automatically, including sample handling, analysis, and result reporting. On the other hand, Semi Automated analyzers require some manual intervention by the operator during the testing process. Both types offer accuracy and efficiency in biochemical analysis, but Fully Automated analyzers are preferred for high-throughput laboratories with high sample volumes, while Semi Automated analyzers are suitable for smaller labs with lower sample volumes.</p></p>
