<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Fuse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Relief Type</li><li>Reflux Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydraulic fuse market comprises of two main types: Pressure Relief Type and Reflux Type. Pressure Relief Type hydraulic fuses work by activating when the pressure exceeds a certain predetermined level, diverting fluid to relieve pressure and prevent damage. On the other hand, Reflux Type hydraulic fuses block the flow of fluid in one direction, allowing flow only in the opposite direction. Both types are crucial in ensuring the safety and efficiency of hydraulic systems by preventing potential damage and maintaining proper fluid flow.</p></p>
