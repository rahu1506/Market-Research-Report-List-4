<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Flange Spreaders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split Type</li><li>Integral Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hydraulic Flange Spreaders are divided into two main types - Split Type and Integral Type. Split Type flange spreaders are designed with two separate halves that can be placed on opposite sides of the flange to spread it apart. This type is typically used for larger flanges that are difficult to access. On the other hand, Integral Type flange spreaders have a single piece design with hydraulic power to spread the flange apart. This type is more commonly used for smaller flanges and offers more precise control over the spreading process.</p></p>
