<p><strong>The Gastrointestinal Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-expanding Metal Stents</li><li>Plastic Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gastrointestinal stents are devices used to keep open blocked or narrowed passages in the gastrointestinal tract. There are two main types of gastrointestinal stents: self-expanding metal stents and plastic stents. Self-expanding metal stents are made of flexible metal mesh that expands once inside the body, providing a sturdy structure to keep the passage open. Plastic stents, on the other hand, are made of a flexible plastic material and are typically used in shorter-term situations. Both types of stents are important tools in the treatment of gastrointestinal obstructions.</p></p>
