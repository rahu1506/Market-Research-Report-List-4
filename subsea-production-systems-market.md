<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Subsea Production Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Type</li><li>Floating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Subsea production systems can be classified into two main types: stationary type and floating type. Stationary type systems are installed on the seabed and remain fixed in place, typically used in shallow waters. Floating type systems, on the other hand, are not fixed to the seabed and float on the surface or are tethered to the seabed, often used in deeper waters where fixed installations are not feasible. Both types play a crucial role in offshore oil and gas production operations.</p></p>
