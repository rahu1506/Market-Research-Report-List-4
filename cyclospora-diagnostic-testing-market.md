<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclospora Diagnostic Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid-fast Staining</li><li>Safranin Staining</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cyclospora is a microscopic parasite that can cause intestinal infection in humans. Diagnostic testing for Cyclospora can be done using Acid-fast staining or Safranin staining methods. Acid-fast staining is a technique that helps to detect the presence of the parasite in stool samples by staining it with a special dye that binds to its unique cell wall structure. Safranin staining, on the other hand, helps to identify Cyclospora by staining it with a red dye under a microscope. Both methods are commonly used to diagnose Cyclospora infections.</p></p>
