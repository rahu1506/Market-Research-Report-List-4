<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propeller Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Propeller Pumps</li><li>Horizontal Propeller Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Propeller pumps are classified into two main types based on their orientation: vertical propeller pumps and horizontal propeller pumps. Vertical propeller pumps are designed to operate in a vertical position, with the motor located above the pump. They are well-suited for applications where space is limited. On the other hand, horizontal propeller pumps are oriented horizontally, with the motor typically located beside the pump. They are commonly used in large-scale industrial and agricultural settings where high flow rates and efficiency are key requirements.</p></p>
