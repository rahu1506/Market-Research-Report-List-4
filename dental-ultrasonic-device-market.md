<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Ultrasonic Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetostrictive</li><li>Piezoelectric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental ultrasonic devices are used for various dental procedures such as scaling and root planning. There are two main types of dental ultrasonic devices: magnetostrictive and piezoelectric. </p><p>Magnetostrictive devices use a magnetic field to create ultrasonic vibrations in a metal stack, which then generates the vibrations necessary for cleaning teeth. Piezoelectric devices, on the other hand, use crystals that expand and contract when an electrical current is applied, producing the vibrations needed for dental procedures. Both types of devices are effective in removing tartar and plaque from teeth.</p></p>
