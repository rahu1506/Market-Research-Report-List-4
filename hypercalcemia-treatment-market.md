<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypercalcemia Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bisphosphonates</li><li>Glucocorticoids</li><li>Calcimimetic Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hypercalcemia treatment market is segmented into three main types: Bisphosphonates, Glucocorticoids, and Calcimimetic Agents. Bisphosphonates work by inhibiting bone resorption and are commonly used for treating hypercalcemia associated with malignancy. Glucocorticoids reduce calcium absorption in the intestines and promote renal excretion. Calcimimetic Agents mimic the action of calcium on the parathyroid gland, thus decreasing parathyroid hormone levels and reducing calcium levels in the blood. These treatments are essential for managing hypercalcemia and preventing potential complications.</p></p>
