<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Union Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Passage</li><li>Single-Passage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of rotary union markets: Multi-Passage and Single-Passage. Multi-Passage rotary unions have multiple passages for fluid transfer, allowing for the simultaneous transfer of different media or functions. They are suitable for applications where multiple functions need to be performed simultaneously. On the other hand, Single-Passage rotary unions have only one passage for fluid transfer, making them ideal for applications where only one function needs to be performed. Each type of rotary union market caters to a specific set of requirements and applications.</p></p>
