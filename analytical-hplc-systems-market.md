<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analytical HPLC Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Phase HPLC</li><li>Reverse Phase HPLC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Analytical HPLC systems are used for separating and analyzing compounds in various industries. Normal phase HPLC is a type of chromatography where the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is non-polar, while reverse phase HPLC is the opposite, with a non-polar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. Normal phase HPLC is typically used for separating polar compounds, while reverse phase HPLC is more commonly used for analyzing non-polar compounds. Both types play a crucial role in analytical chemistry applications.</p></p>
