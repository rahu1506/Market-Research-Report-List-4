<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Open Thermal Switch</li><li>Normally Closed Thermal Switch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal switches are devices that open or close a circuit based on temperature changes. Normally Open Thermal Switches are in an open state at normal temperatures and close when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, allowing current to flow. Normally Closed Thermal Switches, on the other hand, are in a closed state at normal temperatures and open when the temperature rises above a set point, interrupting the current flow. Both types of thermal switches are essential in various industries for temperature control and protection against overheating.</p></p>
