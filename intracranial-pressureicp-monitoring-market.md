<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure(ICP) Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li><li>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring market includes invasive and non-invasive monitoring devices. Invasive ICP monitors involve placing a probe into the brain to directly measure pressure, providing accurate readings but carrying risks such as infection. Non-invasive ICP monitors, on the other hand, use external measurements such as ultrasound or MRI to estimate intracranial pressure without the need for invasive procedures. Both types of monitoring play a crucial role in managing conditions such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage.</p></p>
